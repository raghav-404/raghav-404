# Hey, This is Raghav 🙋🏻‍♂️

I’m a B.Tech student who likes building things with code — especially AI systems that actually *do something* rather than just exist as isolated models.

I pick an idea, break it down, and figure out how the pieces should work together.

Right now, I’m especially interested in **LLMs, agent-style systems, and applied machine learning**.

---

## 🧠 What I Spend Time On

* 🤖 Building **agentic AI systems** using LLMs
* 🧠 Applied machine learning and deep learning

---

## 🧰 Tech I Work With

### Languages

* **Python** (primary language for ML and AI projects)
* **Java / C / C++** (mainly through coursework and fundamentals)

### Libraries & Frameworks

* **NumPy, Pandas** — data handling and experimentation
* **scikit-learn** — classical ML workflows
* **PyTorch** — deep learning and model training
* **LangChain** — LLM-based chatbots and agent workflows

### Tools & Workflow

* **Git** — basic version control for projects
* **VS Code** — primary editor
* **Jupyter Notebook** — experimentation and exploration
* **Virtual environments** and dependency-based setups (`requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`)
* **Windows** as my main development environment

## 📂 What You’ll Find Here

This GitHub contains:

* LLM-based chatbots and agent workflows
* Machine learning and deep learning projects
* Experiments focused on clarity rather than complexity

Each repository reflects what I was trying to learn at that point in time.

## 🌱 Currently Exploring

* Designing cleaner agent workflows
* Making ML code more modular and easier to reason about
* Gradually deepening both fundamentals and newer AI tooling
